# TarkovLens API

## Setup
Configure settings in appsettings.json or appsettings.Development.json. 

Secrets (stuff we want to keep out of source control, e.g. external API keys, production database URLs) should be stored in secrets.json. To create this file, right click the project in the solution explorer and select "Manage User Secrets". Use secrets.example.json as a template.
